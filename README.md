Raytracer
=========

this is a project for our IME's Computer Graphics class:

Implement a non-recursive raytracing algorithm to generate an sphefe image using a Lambertian light model added by and ambient light, already described in a trichromatic form.

Use a white light to light the scene and assume a fixed L vector (distant light).


Produce some pictures varying the position of the light source.
